## Description 
This site is a courtesy of my sweat and hardwork where by if you put your desired sides of the Triangle, it will give you the the answer of the impute side of the consequent Triangle.

## BUGGS
No bugs at the moment.
## B.D.D
The Triangle-Tracker App  gives the answers to your questions of all and about Triangles
you looking for. So for instance, if you put an Input figure like 5,5,5 as the Length, Width, and Height,
**The Output or the Answer will be Equilateral.** If its an Isosceles, it will tell you and if its Scalene it will also tell, you
etc...

The Program recognizes lengths that are **Equal
_Input Example_ : side(a) = 5 side(b) = 5 side(c) = 5

_Output Example_: The Triangle is an **EQUILATERAL**

The Program recognizes **two lengths that are Equal**

_Input Example_ : side(a) = 5 side(b) = 5 side(c) = 3

_Output Example_: The Triangle is an **ISOSCELES

The Program recognizes **lengths that are unequal**

_Input Example_ : side(a) = 1 side(b) = 3 side(c) = 5

_Output Example_: The triangle is a **SCALENE

The **Program recognizes lengths that do not form a triangle**

__Input Example__ : side(a) = 50 side(b) = 30 sidec(c) = 90

__Output Example__: This **NOT A TRIANGLE!!**
