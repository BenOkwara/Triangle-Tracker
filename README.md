## Description 
This site is a courtesy of my sweat and hardwork where by if you put your desired sides of the Triangle, it will give you the the answer of the impute side of the consequent Triangle.

## B.D.D
The Triangle-Tracker App  gives the answers to your questions of all and about Triangles
you looking for. So for instance, if you put an Input figure like 5,5,5 as the Length, Width, and Height,
**The Output or the Answer will be Equilateral.** If its an Isosceles, it will tell you and if its Scalene it will also tell, you
etc...
The Program recognizes length set to zero(0) or is less than zero
INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 0 sideB = 60 sideC = 30

OUTPUT EXAMPLE : Length of sides cannot be equal to or less than zero

The Program recognizes lengths that are Equal
INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The Triangle is an EQUILATERAL

The Program recognizes two lengths that are Equal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 60 sideB = 60 sideC = 30

OUTPUT EXAMPLET: The Triangle is an ISOSCELES

The Program recognizes lengths that are unequal

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 30 sideB = 40 sideC = 60

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: The triangle is a SCALENE

The Program recognizes lengths that do not form a triangle

INPUT EXAMPLE : sideA = 50 sideB = 30 sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: This NOT A TRIANGLE

The Program recognizes empty fields or invalid characters like text

Input : sideA = a sideB = "" sideC = 90

OUTPUT EXAMPLE: TRY AGAIN. EMPTY FIELDS OR WRONG INPUTS
